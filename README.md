# Connect 4 Game

This is a simple Connect 4 game built using Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to connect four pieces of your code vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Players take turns dropping their pieces into one of seven columns, with the piece falling to the lowest available slot in the column. The first player to connect four pieces in a row wins the game.

To play, you have to provide a unique color for both players and then click on the start game button. After the game starts simply click on the column where you want to drop your piece. The game will alternate turns between the players until someone wins or the game ends in a tie.
